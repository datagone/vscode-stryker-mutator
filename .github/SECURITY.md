# 🗝️ Security Policy

## ✔️ Supported Versions

The following restrictions apply for versions that are still supported in terms of security and bug fixes:

- ❔ Must be using the latest major/minor version.
- ❔ Must be using a supported platform for the repository (e.g. VSCode, etc.), and that platform must be within its supported versions (for example: don't use an old version of VSCode, make sure to stay up to date).
- ❔ Repository must not be archived (unless the vulnerability is critical, and the repository moderately popular).
- ✔️ If one of the above doesn't apply to you, feel free to submit an issue and we can discuss the issue/vulnerability further.
