## ‚ùî Why use `Stryker Mutator`

Mutation testing is a powerful technique for improving the quality and reliability of your software. By automatically introducing faults into your codebase and checking if the tests catch them, you can identify weaknesses in your test suite and improve its effectiveness. However, setting up and running mutation testing manually can be time-consuming and error-prone. The `Stryker Mutator` streamlines the mutation testing process by providing an easy-to-use interface for configuring and running the Stryker Mutator framework within your code editor.

With `Stryker Mutator`, you can:

- Improve the quality and reliability of your code by identifying weaknesses in your test suite and addressing them.
- Catch bugs and issues that might otherwise go unnoticed.
- Increase your confidence in your codebase by ensuring that your tests are effective at catching faults.
- Save time and effort by automating the mutation testing process.
- Customize the mutation testing process to fit your specific needs and requirements.
- Easily integrate mutation testing into your development workflow by using the extension directly within your code editor.

Overall, `Stryker Mutator` is a powerful tool for any developer looking to improve the quality and reliability of their codebase.

## üíñ Donations / Sponsors

If you think this code/project is useful to you, I encourage you to make a donation to one of these foundations that I hold dear: [Foundation for Prader-Willi Research Canada](https://www.fpwr.ca/donate/) or [International Prader-Willi Syndrome Organisation](https://ipwso.org/make-a-donation/).

Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized at birth by severe hypotonia, growth disorders, learning disabilities and the appearance of hyperphagia (i.e. always being hungry) during childhood (usually appears between 2 and 8 years of age). Without adequate care (and sometimes despite care) this can lead to the development of morbid obesity. You can learn more about it on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prader%E2%80%93Willi_syndrome), on the [Foundation for Prader-Willi Research](https://www.fpwr.org/) website or on the [International Prader-Willi Syndrome Organisation](https://ipwso.org/) website.
